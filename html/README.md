# Custom integration with SimSage SiteSearch

SimSage SiteSearch enables websites to use SimSageâ€™s search functionality, including automatic operator-handover.
Use the following steps to integrate SimSage with your own site.  We have created a simple-to-follow template for here.
Follow these steps to set up SimSage SiteSearch: 

- Contact SimSage to set up your organisation and get your SimSage ID.
- Put the SimSage search box in the header of every page on your site using the HTML example above.
- Add a new SimSage search result page to your site, and use the HTML, Javascript, CSS as shown in the HTML sample above to enable that functionality.


# SimSage full HTML search example

This example is a fully integrated search box in the header of a page.  
The example displays search-results on a new page called `search-results.html`.

# SimSage settings

It is vitally important that you change the `simsage-settings.js` file before running this demo.
You need to contact SimSage and get the appropriate values for your site.  The default settings below only work for the SimSage companies own SiteSearch.

| setting | description | example value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| base_url | the URL of the SimSage server you're communicating with. | https://cloud.simsage.ai |
| organisation_id | your organisation's ID.  You can get one of these from SimSage. The default value is SimSage's own ID for testing. | c276f883-e0c8-43ae-9119-df8b7df9c574 |
| operator_enabled | Operator functionality enabled / disabled flag.  Set this to `true` if you want to use SimSage's automatic operator handover functionality to connect to a human operator.  This requires the inclusion of the `js/stomp.js` and `js/socks.js` files as described above if set to `true` | true |
